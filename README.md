# scratch2_steroids

In this project we have compared the levels of steroids as well as steroid-metabolizing genes in the endometrium of women who did and did not become pregnant after a first failed in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure. Steroid concentrations in endometrium were measured with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
